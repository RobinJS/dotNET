Have you ever needed some text in an MS Word document to demonstrate something? You know, text where the content just doesn’t matter. Text for the sake of having text to show someone how to do something (text formatting, line spacing, indenting, bulleting, etc). Or, perhaps you just want to play with different fonts. You get the idea.
